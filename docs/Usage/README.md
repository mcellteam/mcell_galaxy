## Galaxy tools to run MCell within Galaxy

This suite of tools supports uploading of MCell/CellBlender data models, 
modification of parameters within models, exporting data models to MDL,
running MCell on exported MDL, plotting results in GnuPlot and MatPlotLib.

When properly installed, the home page of Galaxy should look like this:

The default layout for Galaxy shows three panels:

1. Tools on the left

2. Work area in the center

3. Data sets and data set history on the right

In this picture, the "MCell" tool group has been opened in the left (tools) panel:
